For the most part, everyday solar cells operate at an efficiency of about 18–20%, meaning they convert only a fraction of the sunlight they receive into electricity. While this is far better than the 3–6% efficiency of green plants, it still falls short of meeting large-scale power demands. To generate more usable energy, we can either improve the efficiency of the panels themselves or find ways to maximize the output of the panels we already have.

Most solar panels you see in daily life are mounted in a fixed position, typically facing south at around a 45-degree angle. This setup is simple, reliable, and cost-effective—but it doesn’t capture as much energy as possible throughout the day.

One of the simplest ways to boost performance is through solar tracking systems, which allow panels to follow the sun’s path across the sky. Panels equipped with trackers can generate up to 30% more electricity per day compared to fixed panels.
